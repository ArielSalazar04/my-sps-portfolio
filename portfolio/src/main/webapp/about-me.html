                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p> 
                        I was born and raised in New York my entire life, and I am also of Mexican descent. 
                        I can speak fluent English and Spanish, which is something that I value because I 
                        enjoy making connections with people from both English and Spanish-speaking communities.
                        <br><br>
                        I consider myself a hard-working student with hopes and dreams of obtaining a position 
                        in a software or machine learning engineering career. I also consider myself a laid-back 
                        and friendly person in both my academic and social lives. Although I am competitive, I 
                        strive to be supportive of my peers and help those who are in need. I believe that having 
                        a positive mental attitude is one of the essentials to becoming a better person overall, 
                        and this is why I apply this rule to my endeavors and encourage others to do the same.
                        <br><br>
                        Apart from school, playing billiards and doing parkour are a couple of my other hobbies. 
                        I enjoy playing billiards because it is my way of relieving the stress and burden of my 
                        academic and personal life. Although I do not consistently practice parkour in the same 
                        way I did during high school, I practice it occasionally to stay fit. Both of these 
                        sports have allowed me to maintain good self-esteem and to clear my mind when I need to 
                        take a break. Both billiards and parkour continue to play a significant role in my life 
                        overall.
