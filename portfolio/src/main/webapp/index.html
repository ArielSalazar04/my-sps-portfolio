                            “There's no talent here, this is hard work. This is an obsession. Talent does not exist, 
                            we are all equals as human beings. You could be anyone if you put in the time. You will 
                            reach the top, and that's that. I am not talented. I am obsessed.”

                        <p> 
                            My name is Ariel Salazar. I am currently a junior in college with computer science and 
                            mathematics as my major and minor fields of study. While I have a passion for logic, 
                            mathematics, and problem-solving, it has taken me a lot of time and effort to build the 
                            skills that I have today.
                            <br><br>
                            As I approached my senior year in high school, I was highly motivated to enroll in the 
                            only computer science course that my school offered. However, I did not get a chance to 
                            take it because the computer science program was small and, therefore, the course did not 
                            run during my year. Nevertheless, I did not lose my motivation, and I chose computer 
                            science as my major when I applied to college. Although I did not have any coding experience 
                            before college, I learned a lot during my freshman year, and I quickly became engaged with 
                            the field of study overall. I invested several hours each day practicing what I learned, 
                            and I continuously looked forward to attending the next lecture.
                            <br><br>
                            As of today, computer science is one of my hobbies rather than just an ordinary school subject. 
                            I dedicate a lot of time learning new things every day and becoming more experienced as a 
                            programmer. I strive to do my best, never give up without a fight, and to encourage others 
                            to do the same.
