      <section> Introduction: </section>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p> Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Ariel Salazar and I am thrilled 
          to be a part of the SPS program of 2020. I was born and raised in New York 
          my entire life and I am also of Mexican descent. I can speak fluent English 
          and Spanish, and this is something that I value highly because I enjoy 
          communicating and making connections with people from both communities. As of 
          now, I am a sophomore in college with computer science as my major and mathematics 
          as my minor.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p> I consider myself a hard-working student with hopes and dreams of obtaining 
          a position in a software engineering or data analytics career. I have a huge 
          passion for logic, mathematics, and problem-solving, and I love to challenge
          myself. I have a year and a half of experience as a programmer, and coding has 
          quickly become one of my hobbies. While I consider myself competitive, I also 
          enjoy learning new things everyday about technology. I am also easy-going, friendly, 
          and supportive of my friends and peers. I believe that having a positive mental 
          attitude is one of the essentials to get out of the comfort zone, and so I apply 
          this rule to my endeavors and also encourage others to do the same.

      <section> <br> My Projects: </section>
      <ol type = 1>
          <li> Lotería Mexicana (September 2019 - Present) <br>
              The game Lotería Mexicana, translated as "Mexican Lottery", is a game similar to bingo 
              and traditionally played in Mexico. I coded this game as an iOS app and I taught 
              myself how to code in Swift 3.0. While coding this project, I learned about 
              the Main Storyboard, View Controllers, UI Objects, and other fundamental concepts 
              to iOS app developing. I have committed this project to my GitHub. 
          </li>
          <br>
          <li> Puppy Database with Python and MySQL (October 2019 - February 2020) <br>
              This personal project connects Python with MySQL using MySQL Connector. 
              Throughout the dates specified, I participated in a side business, 
              that sold puppies, by storing all the data into a database in MySQL and using Python
              to make changes in the database and to perform basic statistics.

          This link redirects to a website named ParkourEDU and explains one of the 
          fundamentals moves of parkour: the side-roll. If you do not know already, 
          parkour is a "freedom of movement" activity that consists of using one's 
          running, jumping, and climbing skills to move rapidly in an environment, 
          typically an urban one.
